# U19 Python Pipeline

The `U19-pipeline_python` repository defines the DataJoint tables for the U19 projects.  There is a companion [MATLAB DataJoint pipeline](https://github.com/BrainCOGS/U19-pipeline-matlab) where much of this repository has mirrored table definitions.

## Installation

+ The following instructions will detail two types of installation methods.
  1. User installation to access and fetch data from the database.
  2. Developer installation to set up the pipeline for running analysis and fetching data.

### Recommended prerequisites

+ The following prerequisites are recommended for both installation methods.

    #### Install an integrated development environment

    + DataJoint development and use can be done with a plain text editor in the
      terminal. However, an integrated development environment (IDE) can improve your
      experience. Several IDEs are available.

    + In this setup example, we will use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.
      [Installation instructions here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

    + Install the Jupyter extension for VS Code.

    #### Connect to PNI resources

    + The Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) provides computing resources.  You can optionally use these resources or setup the pipeline on your local machine.

    + Spock is the high performance computational cluster
      ```
      ssh -XY username@spock.pni.princeton.edu
      ```

    + Scotty is used for interactive sessions
      ```
      ssh -XY username@scotty.pni.princeton.edu
      ```

    #### Install a virtual environment

    + A virtual environment allows you to install the packages required for a 
    specific project within an isolated environment on your computer.

    + It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to run the workflow.

    + Conda and virtualenv are virtual environment managers and you can use either 
    option.  Below are the commands for Conda.

    + If you are setting up the pipeline on your local machine follow the instructions below for Conda.  If you are using `spock.pni.princeton.edu` or `scotty.pni.princeton.edu`, Conda is preinstalled and you can access it by running `module load anacondapy/2021.11`.

    + We will install Miniconda which is a minimal installer for conda.
      + Select the [Miniconda installer link](
          https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) 
      for your operating system and follow the instructions.

      + You may need to add the Miniconda directory to the PATH environment 
      variable

        + First locate the Miniconda directory

        + Then modify and run the following command
          ```bash
          export PATH="<absolute-path-to-miniconda-directory>/bin:$PATH"
          ```

    + Create a new conda environment
      + Type the following command into a terminal window
        ```bash
        conda create -n <environment_name> python=<version>
        ```

      + Example command to create a conda environment
        ```bash
        conda create -n U19-pipeline_python python=3.8.11
        ```

    + Activate the conda environment
      ```bash
      conda activate <environment_name>
      ```

    #### Install git
    + Linux and Mac operating systems come preinstalled with Git.  If running in Windows get [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/).

    #### Install graphviz
    + To display DataJoint Diagrams, [install graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

### User installation

+ The following instructions will allow a user to access and fetch data from the database.

    #### Install DataJoint
    + Activate the conda environment
      ```bash
      conda activate <environment_name>
      ```
    
    + Install DataJoint
    ```bash
    pip install datajoint
    ```

    #### Access the database
    + In a new Jupyter notebook, run the following commands.
      ```
      import getpass
      import datajoint as dj
      
      dj.config['database.host'] = 'datajoint00.pni.princeton.edu'
      dj.config['database.user'] = '<username>'
      dj.config['database.password'] = getpass.getpass() # enter the password securily

      scan = dj.create_virtual_module('scan', 'u19_scan_element')
      imaging = dj.create_virtual_module('imaging', 'u19_imaging_element')

      probe = dj.create_virtual_module('probe', 'u19_probe_element')
      ephys = dj.create_virtual_module('ephys', 'u19_ephys_element')
      ```

    + Now that the virtual modules are created to access the tables in the database, you can query and fetch from the database.

### Developer installation

+ The following instructions will allow a user to set up the pipeline for running analysis and fetching data.

    #### Fork and clone the repository
    + In a broswer, navigate to the [BrainCOGS/U19-pipeline_python](https://github.com/BrainCOGS/U19-pipeline_python) repository and fork this repository.

    + In a terminal window, clone your fork of the repository to your local machine.
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/<GitHub username>/U19-pipeline_python.git
      ```
    
    + If you cannot clone repositories with ssh, [set keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

    #### Install the repository

    ```

    #### Configure the DataJoint connection to the database
    + See the following Jupyter notebook to configure DataJoint.
      `notebooks/00-datajoint-configuration.ipynb`

    + Ephys element and imaging element require root paths for ephys and imaging data. Here are the notebooks showing how to set up the configurations properly.

      + [Ephys element configuration](notebooks/ephys_element/00-Set-up-configuration.ipynb)
      + [Imaging element configuration](notebooks/imaging_element/00-Set-up-configration.ipynb)

## Tutorials

We have created some tutorial notebooks to help you start working with DataJoint.

1. Querying data
    + `jupyter notebook notebooks/tutorials/1-Explore U19 data pipeline with DataJoint.ipynb`

2. Building analysis pipelines
    + Recommended if you are going to create new databases or tables for analysis.
    + `jupyter notebook notebooks/tutorials/2-Analyze data with U19 pipeline and save results.ipynb`
    + `jupyter notebook notebooks/tutorials/3-Build a simple data pipeline.ipynb`

## Accessing data files on your system

+ There are several data files (behavior, imaging & electrophysiology) that are referenced in the database.
+ To access thse files you should mount PNI file server volumes on your system.
+ There are three main file servers across PNI where data is stored (braininit, Bezos & u19_dj).

    2. Connect to the Database
    3. Create a structure with subject_fullname and session_date from the session <br>
    ```key['subject_fullname'] = 'koay_K65'``` <br>
    ```key['session_Date'] = '2018-02-05'``` <br>
    4. Fetch filepath info:
    ```data_dir = (acquisition.SessionStarted & key).fetch('remote_path_behavior_file')``` <br>

  ### ephys_element
  + Ephys related tables were created with [DataJoint Element Array Ephys](https://github.com/datajoint/element-array-ephys), processing ephys data aquired with SpikeGLX and pre-processed by Kilosort2.  For this pipeline we are using the (acute) `ephys` module from `element-array-ephys`.

## Datajoint features
Import datajoint as follows:
```python
import datajoint as dj
```

### Update a table entry
`dj.Table._update(schema.Table & key, 'column_name', 'new_data')`

### Get list of all column names in a table (without having to issue a query or fetch)
`table.heading.attributes.keys()`

This also works on a query object:
```python
schema = dj.create_virtual_module("some_schema","some_schema")
query_object = schema.Sample() & 'sample_name ="test"'
query_object.heading.attributes.keys()
```
